There are many static site generators: Gatsby, Hugo, VuePress, JekyII, NextJS. If you have ruby enviroment ready, you may try JekyII.
If you are Windows guy and new to ruby, setup the ruby enviroment will be challenging to you. I would recommend you to try Gatsby and generator.

# Create a jekyllrb 
You may follow [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create a new project. You may [pick up a theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#pick-up-a-theme) first, then clone and modify the demo project. It will save you a lot of time.

I chose [jekyll-theme-simplex](https://github.com/andreondra/jekyll-theme-simplex), and cloned [simplex-demo](https://github.com/andreondra/simplex-demo) as the startpoint of my project.

# Publish the website
## Deploying Jekyll to GitHub PagesGitHub page
GitHub Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub’s github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so they’re a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.

## Deploy to Azure
Azure also provides free [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/) for you to publish your static pages. [publish-jekyll](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-jekyll)

## Using an Azure static web app with a Google domain

If you have good domain, and want to publish to Azure, I would recommend you read [Using an Azure static web app with a Google domain](https://www.cgrimes.dev/using-azure-web-app-with-google-domains/#:~:text=Setup%20your%20www%20subdomain%201%20Azure%20Static%20Web,Configure%20page%20so%20click%20the%20Add%20button%20)
